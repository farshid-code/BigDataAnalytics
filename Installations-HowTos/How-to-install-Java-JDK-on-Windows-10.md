# Installing Java
--------------------
Goal is to install Java on Windows Machine and use it on windows command prompt.

* Let us start and install Java JDK (Java Development Kit)
* Java Development Kit is different than Java Run Time Environment (JRE)

* JDK includes JRE as well.


## Step-1:
-----------

* Download the Java JDK from Oracle Website
http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html

You can download Java JDK 10.
However, we recommend using Java JDK 8.

For Java 8 you can download the file from here
http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html

## Step-2:
-----------

* Double click the exe file and follow the instructions.
* Note where on your PC is Java JDK installed, we need the PATH of it.

On my PC this PATH is "C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_171"
(On your PC this can be different)

## Step-3
----------
* You need to change the PATH variable to make the java and javac commands
available to you on the windows terminal.

* You need to know how to setup environment variables in windows.
In windows 10, you can type on search line
"Edit environment variables for your account"

* You need to setup JAVA_HOME variable because this variable is used by almost all

Then setup JAVA_HOME environment variable. This is where the root directory
of your installation is.

On my PC this PATH is " "
(On your PC this can be different)
